<p><strong>As a registered charity we rely entirely on a team of dedicated volunteers to ensure we can continue to offer our facilities to the residents of Hesketh Bank, Tarleton, Banks and beyond.</strong></p>

<p>If you have an hour to spare each week then get in touch. Our volunteer activities range from meeting current and potential users and ensuring the <a href="<?= $this->sitepath('our-facilities/muga') ?>">MUGA</a> is open and available, to ensuring users have the equipment (tables, chairs etc) that they need.</p>

<p>Volunteering is a great way to meet people around the village and would suit someone retired, semi-retired or just stuck at home.</p>

<p>If you want to know more then email <a href="info@heskethbankcommunitycentre.org.uk">info@heskethbankcommunitycentre.org.uk</a> or call us on <strong>07784 642 127</strong>.</p>
